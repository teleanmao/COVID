# COVID
An ABM for COVID transmission on campus

The model will simulate the whole process when students are on campus for in-person teaching and whether COVID-19 will be contained as soon as possible when new infected cases are confirmed on campus.

This model will involve various variables, such as the social distance amongst students, class duration, student size, etc.
